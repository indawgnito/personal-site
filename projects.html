          <h3>1. Spent Fuel Cell Coordinate Calculation</h3>
          <p>
            During my internship with Westinghouse this summer, I was tasked
            with developing a Python application, complete with custom data
            structures and a Kivy user interface, that would significantly speed
            up the process of calculating fuel cell coordinates in spent nuclear
            fuel pools around the world. These coordinates are important to
            have, so that the cranes which are responsible for moving this spent
            fuel in and out of cells know where exactly to move. The software
            was a success, and will ultimately decrease the time needed to
            complete this task from many hours to just a few minutes. The code
            efficiently performs calculations by considering the given pool's
            specifications, all while providing a smooth user experience and
            accounting for real world variability and inaccuracy. The photo
            below shows one spent fuel pool, containing racks which in turn
            contain the spent fuel cells.

          <h3>2. Homerun Vision App</h3>
          <p>
            Back in April of 2023 I began working with my father, Dr. Dave Webb,
            the author of Homerun Leadership, on an app that would help bring
            his business to more companies and teams. The app is called Homerun
            Vision, and it helps teams find their most important objective and
            brainstorm ways to contribute to achieving it. The app entered
            public beta testing in early September, and I received great
            feedback after sitting in on a real meeting where the tool was used,
            as seen in the photo. Homerun Vision was built with a NextJS front
            end and a Supabase backend, and will be released to the public in
            the coming months.

          <h3>3. MyndfulApp</h3>
          <p>
            In September of 2023 I decided to tackle a project I had been
            considering for some time, to help grow my understanding of HTTP
            requests and API interaction. Using NextJS, I constructed a simple
            webapp designed to help people practice mindfulness in a new way. It
            uses the info that the user enters to generate a custom meditation
            for them in plaintext format from GPT 4 using the OpenAI API. The
            text is then sent to the ElevenLabs via their API and the user is
            returned a complete meditation session as an audio file, in which
            they are referred to by name and guided through the meditation. I
            plan to refine this app and bring it online in early 2024.
